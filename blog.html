          <h3>Criteria to Consider When Picking the Programming Course</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">So, how to choose a programming course and why is it so important to pick the right one? Let’s figure it out.</p>
          <h4>Criteria 1. Focus on Practice</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">You definitely need theoretical knowledge to learn programming, but this is not enough. Theory is ineffective if you don’t put the skills you’ve learned into practice immediately, because writing code is programming itself! This is why it makes sense to consider practice-oriented online learning that will allow you to ultimately transform your knowledge into a true real-world project. So, the ideal ratio for learning to code should be 20/80, allowing you to read lectures or watch videos 20% of the time and write code the remaining 80%.</p>
          <h4>Criteria 2. Focus on Practice</h4>
          <p class="text-justify">You definitely need theoretical knowledge to learn programming, but this is not enough. Theory is ineffective if you don’t put the skills you’ve learned into practice immediately, because writing code is programming itself!

          <h4>Criteria 3. Community </h4>
          <p class="text-justify">Community is something that deserves a separate post. But, to cut a long story short, the community is vital on the long road of learning to program.
            There is nothing better than when you have someone you can turn to in moments of frustration or when experiencing difficulties during the learning process. That is why it is important to make sure the course you get involved in boasts a supportive community, where you can always seek help. The feel of support keeps you motivated and doesn’t even leave you a chance to quit. So, consider checking if the course has active forums before stepping in.</p>
